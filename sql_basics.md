## Find All Columns and Rows in a Table


```
SELECT * FROM <table name>;

```

The asterisk or star symbol (`*`) means all columns.

The semi-colon (`;`) terminates the statement like a period in sentence or question mark in a question.

Examples:

```
SELECT * FROM books;
SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM countries;
```

## Retrieving Specific Columns of Information


Retrieving a single column:

```
SELECT <column name> FROM <table name>; 
```

Examples:

```
SELECT email FROM users;
SELECT first_name FROM users;
SELECT name FROM products;
SELECT zip_code FROM addresses;
```

Retrieving multiple columns:

```
SELECT <column name 1>, <column name 2>, ... FROM <table name>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;
SELECT name, description, price FROM products;
SELECT title, author, isbn, year_released FROM books;
SELECT name, species, legs FROM pets;
```

## Aliasing Column Names
To alias a column name to something of your chossing i.e. change the column header:

```
SELECT <column name> AS <alias> FROM <table name>;
SELECT <column name> <alias> FROM <table name>;

```

Examples:

```
SELECT username AS Username, first_name AS "First Name" FROM users;
SELECT title AS Title, year AS "Year Released" FROM movies;
SELECT name AS Name, description AS Description, price AS "Current Price" FROM products;
SELECT name Name, description Description, price "Current Price" FROM products;
```
## Finding the Data You Want

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
```

| Operator | Name               | True Examples        |
|----|--------------------------|----------------------|
| =  | equality                 | "Andrew" = "Andrew"  |
| != | inequality               | "Andrew" != "Laura"  |
| <  | less than                | 1 < 40, 39 < 40      |
| <= | less than or equal to    | 1 <= 40, 40 <= 40    |
| >  | greater than             | 100 > 40, 100 > 99   |
| >= | greater than or equal to | 100 >= 99, 100 >=100 | 

### Equality Operator

Find all rows that a given value matches a column's value.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> = <value>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name = "Andrew";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count = 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published = 1999;
```

Please note that the equality operator is case sensitive, "Chalkley" is not the same as "chalkley". For the numeric types you don't need quotation marks, for the text and date types you do.

### Inequality Operator


Find all rows that a given value doesn't match a column's value.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> != <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <> <value>;
```

The not equal to or inequality operator can be written in two ways `!=` and `<>`. The latter is *less* common.

Examples:

```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name != "Kenneth";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name != "L:one";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count != 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published != 2015;
```

### Relational Operators

There are several relational operators you can use:

* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to
* `>` greater than
* `>=` greater than or equal to

These are primarily used to compare *numeric* and *date/time* types.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> < <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <= <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> > <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> >= <value>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1998-12-01';
SELECT title AS "Book Title", author AS Author FROM books WHERE year_released <= 2015;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price > 9.99;
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE release_year >= 2000;
```

### More Than One Condition

You can compare multiple values in a `WHERE` condition. If you want to test that *both* conditions are true use the `AND` keyword, or *either* conditions are true use the `OR` keyword.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> AND <condition 2> ...;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> OR <condition 2> ...;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley" AND first_name = "Andrew";
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Games Consoles" AND price < 400;
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = "The Matrix" OR title = "The Matrix Reloaded" OR title = "The Matrix Revolutions";
SELECT country FROM countries WHERE population < 1000000 OR population > 100000000;
```

### Searching in a Set of Values

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```

Examples:

```
SELECT name FROM islands WHERE id IN (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ("eBooks", "Books", "Comics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic IN ("JavaScript", "Databases", "CSS");
SELECT * FROM campaigns WHERE medium IN ("email", "blog", "ppc");
```


To find all rows that are not in the set of values you can use `NOT IN`.

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column>  NOT IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```
Examples:

```
SELECT answer FROM answers WHERE id IN (7, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category NOT IN ("Electronics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic NOT IN ("SQL", "NoSQL");
```

### Searching within a Range of Values

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> BETWEEN <lesser value> AND <greater value>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 9.99 AND 19.99;
SELECT name, appointment_date FROM appointments WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN "2015-01-01" AND "2015-01-07";
```

### Pattern Matching

Placing the percent symbol (`%`) any where in a string in conjunction with the `LIKE` keyword will operate as a wildcard. Meaning it can be substituted by any number of characters, including zero!

```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire";
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "Alien%";
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name LIKE "%drew";
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE "%Brief History%";
```

#### PostgreSQL Specific Keywords

`LIKE` in PostgreSQL is case-sensitive. To do case-insensitive searches use `ILIKE`.

```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name ILIKE "%drew";
```

### Missing Values

```
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> IS NULL;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM vhs_rentals WHERE returned_on IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM car_rentals WHERE returned_on IS NULL AND location = "PDX";
```

To filter out missing values use can use `IS NOT NULL`.

```
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL;
```

Examples

```
SELECT * FROM people WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE zip_code IS NOT NULL;
```
